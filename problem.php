                Breakfast is a very important meal and is absolutely necessary to maintain a healthy life.
                During the 2014 - 2015 school year, 48.5% of adolescents reported that they skipped breakfast 
                at least once a week. Eventhough they skip breakfast, they have th eopportunity to feed themselves at school during lunch
                Now with COVID-19, many schools have offered free or reduced school lunch prices; this is the first step.
                We have enough food for everyone too, yet there is a significant amount of food waste.

                        School lunch lines are often really long and this discourages students from getting lunch.
                        By the time the lunch line dissipates, lunch is already over, and students are expected to go to their 
                        class.

                        11.3% of food waste happens in distribution. Schools often bring in more food than is 
                        needed to ensure that no student is left hungry. If only schools knew how much food 
                        needed to be ordered to reduce waste...
